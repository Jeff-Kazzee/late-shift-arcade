Vivary agent workspace scaffold.

Preset: coding

Start here:

1. Read `AGENTS.md` for the workspace contract.
2. Read `STATE.md` for current truth.
3. Use `modules/index.md` to choose the one module index relevant to the task.
4. Fill `USER.md` and `MEMORY.md` locally; they are private and gitignored.
5. Use `tropo check --root .` to validate the typed workspace graph.

The scaffold includes tropo for typed workspace knowledge, strato for the agent OS,
runtime skills for Claude/Codex-style agents, and a starter graph under
`modules/`, `changes/`, `decisions/`, `verification/`, and `gates/`.

Module rule: each generated module is a directory with one `index.md`. The index is
the lightweight router; put deeper context behind links instead of duplicating it.

Preset starter:

- Module: `codebase`
- First slice: `local-ci-baseline`
- Verification: `local-checks`
